# 1. eCR Now Background
The purpose of the eCR Now FHIR App is to enable vendors to perform eCR reporting for COVID-19 for sites which do not currently have eCR reporting implemented via other mechanisms that are currently supported by the public health agencies. 

# 2. App Architecture # 
The app is architected as a Java Spring Boot app using Java Spring framework for the application layer, Hibernate and Postgres for the backend technologies and ReactJS for the front end. The app can be instantiated as a micro service and containerized using Docker or other technologies for deployments. 

The app components are as described below:

## 2.1 SMART on FHIR Module: ##
This module has the ability to collect patient and encounter context for the eCR reporting via SMART on FHIR Launch currently. Other launch mechanisms to collect the necessary context are being explored with vendors. The module authenticates using SMART on FHIR OAuth protocols. Once authenticated and authorized the module interacts with the EHR and queries for data that is needed to examine if a Patient qualifies for COVID reporting. This is done by a set of queries called Trigger Queries. Once a patient qualifies and an eICR has to be created, the module queries the EHR for the necessary data to create the eICR. The queries used to collect data for creating an eICR are called Loading Queries. 
Currently the app supports FHIR DSTU2 and the queries used are based on the Argonaut Data Query Implementation Guide Version 1.0.0 and can be accessed here: https://www.fhir.org/guides/argonaut/r2/. FHIR STU3 and FHIR Release 4 are in the pipeline to be supported.

## 2.2 ERSD Module: ##
This module ingests the trigger code defintions, timing parameter defintions for eCR reporting. These defintions are published using the Electronic Reporting and Surveillance Distribution (ERSD) transactions and profiles which are outlined and described in the eCR FHIR IG version 1.0.0 located http://hl7.org/fhir/us/ecr/. The ERSD module uses FHIR Release 4.

## 2.3 ECA Module: ##
The ECA module implements a very primitive light weight Event, Condition, Action model to handle the different events in the eCR reporting workflows. The current workflows handle the following events and actions. 
* Matching Trigger Codes
* Create eICR
* Close Out eICR 
* Submit eICR

## 2.4 HL7 CDA Generator Module: ##
The HL7 CDA Generator module is a very simple set of transforms to create a eICR report following the HL7 CDAÂ® R2 Implementation Guide: Public Health Case Report, Release 2: the Electronic Initial Case Report (eICR), Release 1, STU Release 1.1 - US Realm which can be accessed at https://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=436. The reason for using the above version is to leverage the existing infrastructure that is being used by public health agencies. In the future as we migrate to newer versions of the implementation guide, the module will be changed to use the transforms published by the IGs.

## 2.5 Routing Module: ##
The routing module is used to submit/transmit the eICR created to the public health agencies. Currently the Direct Transport is integrated into the app. Future versions will add other modes of submission which may include IHE XDR, HL7 FHIR among others. 

# 3. Build and Deploy #

## 3.1 Pre-Requisites: ##
The following technologies should have been installed on your machine where you will build, test and deploy your applications.

* Java 8 or higher.
* PostgresSql Database 10.x or higher.
* NodeJS 12.4.1 or above
* Maven 3.3.x or higher.
* git tool.

## 3.2 Steps to Build and Run the App: ##

1. Clone the repository

```git clone https://github.com/drajer-health/eCRNow.git```

### Steps to run the project ###
* Download the source code by using GIT clone or fork.
* Create database with name R4 (default database name in application.properties) or any other name
* Update src/main/resources/application.properties values accordingly
* Go to project directory and run "mvn clean install" to build the project
* Go to target directory and run "java -jar plandefinition-processor-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar"
